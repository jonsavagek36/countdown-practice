Chatbomb's Chat Timer feature suffered from bugs, inconsistencies, and all around design-flaws.
In order to make Chatbomb2.1 work the way it should, I realized I needed to get the Chat Timer's
start/stop feature and the add-time feature working properly.<br />
<br />
I wrote this fairly hacky solution, but I'm hoping to get a better one working asap.
